</strong><br>At a distance of 7 kms from Kodaikanal Bus Station, Pillar Rocks is a set of three giant rock pillars which stand 400 feet high from the ground.
<br>The rocks stand majestically and offer wonderful views amidst thick vegetation and cloudy mountains. This is one of the best tourist places to visit in Kodaikanal and among the most scenic places in Kodai.
<br>Managed by the Tamil Nadu Forest Department, the viewpoint of Pillar Rock is situated on the Moir Point road. A small and beautifully garden, glowing in the colors of the seasonal blooms adds to the charm and the picture perfect beauty of the place.
<br>In the shadows of the pillars are shady woods that invite picnickers. The dramatic view and the scenic surroundings make Pillars Rocks a popular picnic spot among locals and tourists.
<br>During winter and monsoons, the rocks are surrounded by thick clouds and tourists keep waiting for long time for the clouds to be cleared to get a glimpse of the clear rock view.
<br>And the waiting is worth with magnificent view of the rocks surrounded by clouds.
The top of the Rocks used to have access through a short, steep trek around the hillside (the walk to the rocks is currently prohibited due to suicide cases).<br></p>
